# Traffic-Light-Classifier-Symbolic-AI

This project aims to build a fully functional symbolic AI traffic light classifier, using a variety of computer vision techniques, to be integrated into a self-driving car. It successfully classified 97% of the images, with no red misclassifications as green to maximize safety. A second version of the code achieves 99% accuracy, but with one red misclassification as green of a low-quality image.
